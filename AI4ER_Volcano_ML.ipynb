    "\n",
    "## Purpose of this session\n",
    "### Broader Context\n",
    "Image analysis is a field with clear targets for machine learning approaches. Furthermore, many environmental applications use spectral imaging - the acquisition of a spectrum at each pixel. This is a language that will likely become familiar to you from the treatment of satellite data to map features on the global scale. At the other extreme of spatial scales, the examination of environmental materials by electron microscopy is evolving rapidly due to rapid advances in instrumentation the application of techniques developed in materials science to earth and environmental problems. \n",
    "### Key Skills\n",
    "- Run Jupyter Notebook in Jupyter Lab from Binder\n",
    "- Use of HyperSpy package for handling electron microscope data\n",
    "- Use of Skimage package for image processing\n",
    "- Application of Machine Learning techniques to Phase Identification\n",
    "- Masking and Segmentation of phases\n",
    "- Extraction of rock textural properties (Crystal Sizes and Shapes)\n",
    "- Estimating magmatic timescales"

    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a [phase map](https://academic.oup.com/view-large/figure/82008133/egu058f10p.png) of a rock from the active volcanic zones of Iceland.\n",
    "The image is from [Neave et al., 2014](https://academic.oup.com/petrology/article/55/12/2311/1558945).\n",
    "It was generated using a commerical system called QEMSCAN that is a piece of software that is linking to a scanning electron microcope (SEM).\n",
    "You can see from the scale that we are looking at map of a 'thin section' prepared from the rock - you saw some of these in the lecture slides, as well as the SEM in the Department of Earth Sciences. The rocks are made of 'phases'. Each phase has a distinctive composition and set of thermodynamic properties which are determined by the crystalline (or glass) structure of the cooled lava. These phase names (e.g. olivine, plagioclase, clinopyroxene) are displayed on the legend of the figure along with the colours. In essence the QEMSCAN system is performing an advanced form of colour-by-numbers. The question is - how does it do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "This raw data that goes into generation of these maps is acquired using a technique known as Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). The SEM fires an electron beam at a focussed point on the sample surface, causing electrons to shift around energy levels and then to release X-rays - which are gathered by the EDS detectors. A spectrum is generated and the position of peaks can be attributed to characteristic energies that are associated with elements. The peak height is linked to the concentration of the element in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "The QEMSCAN software converts the spectrum for each pixel into an estimate of the chemical composition of that point, and then uses a series of logical filters on the compositional data to match each pixel to a phase. For example, olivine is a mineral that contains This means that a large database of phases has to be accessed and the selection of possible phases is not guided by the compositional variations observed within the sample itself."

    "An alternative approach with considerable promise in this field is to base the identification of phases directly on the available EDS data. In order to understand how we might be able to use this approach we are going to work through a set of activties in this notebook, starting from data input/output through to quantification of the rock textures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets are large and some of the ML processing is computationally expensive. For this practical we will therefore work with relatively small portions of the images, but will import results from larger images that have been calculated beforehand - Matt or Norbert might well say - \"Here's one that I made earlier\"."
